# First attempt of doing fluid simulation 
ref. of that article: https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/public_user/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf

I'm refactoring the code in the main article so it can be ran in a reasonable amount of time (3D to 2D simulations), and trying to visualise the results... (WIP).
